# Project Euler

I have tried to make my solutions as clear as possible to help and encourage more people to start using Project Euler as
a way to learn about both CS and Math! I have added plenty of comments on all solutions as well as explaining the 
"strategy" if I felt it was complicated/tricky and needed to be explained. All of my solutions run well under the minute
(most run in 0-2 seconds)
