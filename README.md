# Project Euler

###### Problems Solved: 60

I have tried to make my solutions as clear as possible to help and encourage more people to start using Project Euler as
a way to learn about both CS and Math! I have added plenty of comments on all solutions as well as explaining the 
"strategy" if I felt it was complicated/tricky and needed to be explained. All of my solutions run well under the minute
(most run in 0-2 seconds)

I highly recommend using: https://projecteuler.net/ as a way to gain critical thinking skills and challenge yourself! We
often spend too long learning about algorithms without applying them, and this can be detrimental to our learning. That
being said, DO NOT use these solutions to avoid having to think about the problem yourself. I have posted these solutions
to assist you if you are stuck on a problem for too long and feel that you need some assistance OR if you have already
solved the problem and simply want to see how someone else did it. I repeat, DO NOT use these solutions as a replacement
for having to think about the problem, I'm not quite sure why you would even want to do that, it is only for your own learning...

Best of luck!
